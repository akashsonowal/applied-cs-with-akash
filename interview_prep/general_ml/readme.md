1st interview
This round was based on data structures and algorithms. I was asked two medium LC questions. One was to add two numbers given as Linked Lists.

2nd interview
This round was based on breadth and depth of Machine Learning.
We started off by discussing the projects and past internships mentioned in my resume, went on to discuss some (4-5) research papers related to my experience.
Then, the interviewer asked some general ML concepts such as
1) What is regularization? Differentiate between lasso and ridge regularization. Why does regularization lead to sparse weights?
2) What are resnets? How do they work?
3) Difference between MLE and MAP
4) Bias-Variance Tradeoff
5) Precision-Recall in classification
6) K-means clustering
7) Dealing with very large feature spaces
8) SVM
9) Attention in Seq2Seq models
10) Bayesian Learning principle
11) Dimensionality Reduction, PCA
12) What are eigenvectors and eigen values
