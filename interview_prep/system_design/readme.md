Units Cheat Sheet
These values are defined by the International System of Units.
* 1kB = 1000 bytes
* 1MB = 1000kB
* 1GB=1000MB
* 1TB =1000GB
* 1PB=1000TB
Storage Scale Cheat Sheet
* Acharacter
=>1 byte
* Typical metadata for a "thing," excluding images (name, description, other attributes, etc.)
=>~1-10KB
* A high-quality 1920x1080p image
=> ~2M8 (realistically can be lossy-compressed by ~10-20x)
* 20 minutes of HD video
=>~1GB
Storage Capacity Cheat Sheet
How much storage can a single industry-grade machine have?
« ~1078 disk space
« ~256GB-1TB of RAM (178 for really large/optimized machines)
Latency Cheat Sheet
How long does it take for a regular HTTP request to make a round trip, not bound by bandwidth?
« Intra-continental
=>~50-150ms
« Cross-continental
=>~200-500ms
Bandwidth Cheat Sheet
« Mobile phone (4G)
=> ~13MB/s
« Public internet (home WiFi)
