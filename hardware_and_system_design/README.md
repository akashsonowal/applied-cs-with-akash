# Computer Hardware

## Computers
- A processor (CPU): execute the program we give (in addition to running the OS and many more things), typically consists of 8 or more cores.
- Memory (RAM): To store and retrieve the results from computation. (weight vectors, activations, training data)
- An Ethernet Network connection (sometimes multiples): speed 1 GB/s to 100 GB/s.
- A speed expansion bus to connect system to one or more GPUs (PCIe): servers have upto 8 accelerators (GPUs). Desktop has 2.
- Durable Storage (magnetic Hard Disk Drive, Solid State Drive) in many cases connected using PCIe bus.It provides efficient transfer of training data and storage of checkpoints.
